export const DEFAULT_TEXT = `Batman is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. Batman was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939.

In the DC Universe, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha as a child, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night.

Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City with assistance from various supporting characters, including his butler Alfred, police commissioner James Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth.

The character was originally introduced as a dark avenger with a vendetta. Later stories brought a lighter tone to the character and introduced child sidekick Robin. The mid-1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended.

Detective Comics #27 featured the debut of Batman. The name "Bat-Man" was inspired by da Vinci's diagram of an ornithopter, a flying machine with huge wings like a bat. Kane conceived the character after discussing with writer Bill Finger.

Batman's personality is complex, driven by tragedy and a quest for justice. Bruce Wayne acts as a socialite to maintain his secret identity while channeling his resources into fighting crime. His dual identity allows him to operate both in high society and on the streets.

The Batcave serves as Batman's secret headquarters and command center. Located beneath Wayne Manor, it houses his crime-fighting equipment, trophies from past cases, and computer systems used to monitor Gotham City and coordinate with allies.

Batman's rogues gallery is considered one of the best in comics, including iconic villains like the Joker, Penguin, Riddler, Two-Face, and Catwoman. These adversaries often mirror aspects of Batman's own psyche and provide psychological depth to his stories.

The character has been adapted into various media including several films, animated series, and video games. Each interpretation brings unique elements while maintaining core aspects of the character's mythology and moral code.

Batman's no-kill rule is a fundamental aspect of his character. Despite the trauma and darkness he faces, he refuses to use lethal force, believing that crossing that line would make him no better than the criminals he fights.

The Bat-Signal is a distress signal device that appears in the sky over Gotham City, summoning Batman to action. It's typically used by Police Commissioner James Gordon to alert Batman to emergencies requiring his assistance.

Batman is part of the Justice League, where he works alongside other superheroes like Superman and Wonder Woman. His tactical genius and detective skills make him invaluable to the team despite lacking superpowers.

Wayne Enterprises is the multinational conglomerate run by Bruce Wayne. It provides the financial resources and technological innovations that fuel Batman's crime-fighting activities while serving as Bruce Wayne's public persona.

Batman's extensive training includes martial arts mastery, detective skills, escape artistry, forensics, and advanced technology. He is often described as the world's greatest detective, combining physical prowess with intellectual capabilities.`;
